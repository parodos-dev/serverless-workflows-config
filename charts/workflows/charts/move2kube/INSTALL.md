Move2kube
===========

# Configuration

We need to use `initContainers` and `securityContext` in our Knative services to allow SSH key exchange in move2kube workflow, we have to tell Knative to enable that feature:
```bash
  oc patch configmap/config-features \
    -n knative-serving \
    --type merge \
    -p '{"data":{"kubernetes.podspec-init-containers": "enabled", "kubernetes.podspec-securitycontext": "enabled"}}'

```

Also, `move2kube` instance runs as root so we need to allow the `default` service account to use `runAsUser`:
```console
oc -n sonataflow-infra adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
```

Create the secret that holds the ssh keys:
```console
oc create secret generic sshkeys --from-file=id_rsa=${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa --from-file=id_rsa.pub=${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -n sonataflow-infra
```
If you change the name of the secret, you will also have to updated the value of `sshSecretName` in [values.yaml](values.yaml)

If you want to use other ssh keys you should update the `from-file` parameters values to match your own.

If you do not have ssh keys, you can generate them with `ssh-keygen` command. You can for instance refer to https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent 

Note that those ssh keys needs to be added in your git repository as well. For bitbucket it should be on the account level (https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/ssh-keys/)

# Installation


From `charts` folder run 
```console
helm install move2kube workflows/move2kube --namespace=sonataflow-infra
```
Run the following command to apply it to the `move2kubeURL` parameter:
```console
M2K_ROUTE=$(oc -n sonataflow-infra get routes move2kube-route -o yaml | yq -r .spec.host)
oc -n sonataflow-infra delete ksvc m2k-save-transformation-func &&
helm upgrade move2kube move2kube --namespace=sonataflow-infra --set workflow.move2kubeURL=https://${M2K_ROUTE} &&
oc -n sonataflow-infra scale deployment m2k --replicas=0 &&
oc -n sonataflow-infra scale deployment m2k --replicas=1
```
