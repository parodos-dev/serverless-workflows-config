            Returns the details for an issue.

            The issue is identified by its ID or key, however, if the identifier doesn't match an issue, a case-insensitive search and check for moved issues is performed. If a matching issue is found its details are returned, a 302 or other redirect is **not** returned. The issue key returned in the response is the key of the issue found.

            This operation can be accessed anonymously.

            **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

             *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
             *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.

              A list of fields to return for the issue. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list. Use it to retrieve a subset of fields. Allowed values:

               *  `*all` Returns all fields.
               *  `*navigable` Returns navigable fields.
               *  Any issue field, prefixed with a minus to exclude.

              Examples:

               *  `summary,comment` Returns only the summary and comments fields.
               *  `-description` Returns all (default) fields except description.
               *  `*navigable,-comment` Returns all navigable fields except comment.

              This parameter may be specified multiple times. For example, `fields=field1,field2& fields=field3`.

              Note: All fields are returned by default. This differs from [Search for issues using JQL (GET)](#api-rest-api-2-search-get) and [Search for issues using JQL (POST)](#api-rest-api-2-search-post) where the default is all navigable fields.

          summary: Create issue
          description: |-
            Creates an issue or, where the option to create subtasks is enabled in Jira, a subtask. A transition may be applied, to move the issue or subtask to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue properties set.

            The content of the issue or subtask is defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are determined using the [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same fields that appear on the issue's create screen. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

            Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

             *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
             *  `parent` must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

            In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing that the parent and child are members of the same project.

            **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project in which the issue or subtask is created.

            Projects are the unit of isolation and collaboration in OpenShift. A project has one or more members, a quota on the resources that the project may consume, and the security controls on the resources in the project. Within a project, members may have different roles - project administrators can set membership, editors can create and manage the resources, and viewers can see but not access running containers. In a normal cluster project administrators are not able to alter their quotas - that is restricted to cluster administrators.

            Listing or watching projects will return only projects the user has the reader role on.

            An OpenShift project is an alternative representation of a Kubernetes namespace. Projects are exposed as editable to end users while namespaces are not. Direct creation of a project is typically restricted to administrators, while end users should use the requestproject resource.

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

            The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

            `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

            When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
              is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
              and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
              to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
              If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
              bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
              when request started being processed.
            - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
              Invalid error is returned.

            Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
